  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Establishing Total Body Irradiation (TBI) using 
  Helical Tomotherapy (HT) to gain better control over dose distribution and 
  homogeneity and to individually spare organs at risk. Because of their 
  limited body length the technique seems especially eligible in juvenile 
  patients.
  
  PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cohort consisted of 10 patients, 6 female and 4 
  male, aged 4 - 22 y with acute lymphoblastic- (ALL) or acute myeloic leukemia 
  (AML). All patients presented with high risk disease features. Body length in 
  treatment position ranged from 110-180 cm. Two Gy single dose was applied BID 
  to a total dose of 12 Gy. Dose volume constraint for the PTV was 95\% dose 
  coverage for 95\% of the volume. The lungs were spared to a mean dose of 
  [less than or equal to] 10 Gy. Patients were positioned in a vac-loc bag in 
  supine position with a 3-point head mask.
  
  RESULTS: Average D95 to the PTV was 11.7 Gy corresponding to a mean coverage 
  of the PTV of 97.5\%. Dmean for the lungs was 9.14 Gy. Grade 3-4 side effects 
  were not observed.
  
  CONCLUSIONS: TBI using HT is feasible and well tolerated. A benefit could be 
  demonstrated with regard to dose distribution and homogeneity and the 
  selective dose-reduction to organs at risk.},

@article{Hauswald2013,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with malignant melanoma may develop brain 
  metastases during the course of the disease, requiring radiotherapeutic 
  treatment. In patients with 1-3 brain metastases, radiosurgery has been 
  established as a treatment option besides surgery. For patients with 4 or 
  more brain metastases, whole brain radiotherapy is considered the standard 
  treatment. In certain patients with brain metastases, radiation treatment 
  using whole brain helical Tomotherapy with integrated boost and 
  hippocampal-sparing may improve prognosis of these patients.
  
  METHODS/DESIGN: The present prospective, randomized two-armed trial aims to 
  exploratory investigate the treatment response to conventional whole brain 
  radiotherapy applying 30 Gy in 10 fractions versus whole brain helical 
  Tomotherapy applying 30 Gy in 10 fractions with an integrated boost of 50 Gy 
  to the brain metastases as well as hippocampal-sparing in patients with brain 
  metastases from malignant melanoma. The main inclusion criteria include 
  magnetic resonance imaging confirmed brain metastases from a 
  histopathologically confirmed malignant melanoma in patients with a minimum 
  age of 18 years. The main exclusion criteria include a previous radiotherapy 
  of the brain and not having recovered from acute high-grade toxicities of 
  prior therapies. The primary endpoint is treatment-related toxicity. 
  Secondary endpoints include imaging response, local and loco-regional 
  progression-free survival, overall survival and quality of life.

@article{Gondi2010,
  abstract = {PURPOSE: Sparing the hippocampus during cranial irradiation poses 
  important technical challenges with respect to contouring and treatment 
  planning. Herein we report our preliminary experience with whole-brain 
  radiotherapy using hippocampal sparing for patients with brain metastases.
  
  METHODS AND MATERIALS: Five anonymous patients previously treated with 
  whole-brain radiotherapy with hippocampal sparing were reviewed. The 
  hippocampus was contoured, and hippocampal avoidance regions were created 
  using a 5-mm volumetric expansion around the hippocampus. Helical tomotherapy 
  and linear accelerator (LINAC)-based intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) 
  treatment plans were generated for a prescription dose of 30 Gy in 10 
  fractions.
  
  RESULTS: On average, the hippocampal avoidance volume was 3.3 cm(3), 
  occupying 2.1\% of the whole-brain planned target volume. Helical tomotherapy 
  spared the hippocampus, with a median dose of 5.5 Gy and maximum dose of 12.8 
  Gy. LINAC-based IMRT spared the hippocampus, with a median dose of 7.8 Gy and 
  maximum dose of 15.3 Gy. On a per-fraction basis, mean dose to the 
  hippocampus (normalized to 2-Gy fractions) was reduced by 87\% to 0.49 Gy(2) 
  using helical tomotherapy and by 81\% to 0.73 Gy(2) using LINAC-based IMRT. 
  Target coverage and homogeneity was acceptable with both IMRT modalities, 
  with differences largely attributed to more rapid dose fall-off with helical 
  tomotherapy.
  
  CONCLUSION: Modern IMRT techniques allow for sparing of the hippocampus with 
  acceptable target coverage and homogeneity. Based on compelling preclinical 
  evidence, a Phase II cooperative group trial has been developed to test the 
  postulated neurocognitive benefit.},

  abstract = {Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) proved to be an effective 
  treatment with acceptable toxicity for lung tumors. However, the use of 
  helical intensity-modulated (IM) SBRT is controversial. We investigated the 
  outcome of lung tumor patients treated by IMSBRT using helical tomotherapy 
  with a Japanese standard fractionation schedule of 48 Gy in 4 fractions (n = 
  37) or modified protocols of 50-60 Gy in 5-8 fractions (n = 35). Median 
  patient's age was 76 years and median follow-up period for living patients 
  was 20 months (range, 6-46). The median PTV was 6.9 cc in the 4-fraction 
  group and 14 cc in the 5- to 8-fraction group (P = 0.001). Grade 2 radiation 
  pneumonitis was seen in 2 of 37 patients in the 4-fraction group and in 2 of 
  35 patients in the 5- to 8-fraction group (log-rank P = 0.92). Other major 
  complications were not observed. The LC rates at 2 years were 87\% in the 
  4-fraction group and 83\% in the 5- to 8-fraction group. Helical IMSBRT for 
  lung tumors is safe and effective. Patients with a high risk of developing 
  severe complications may also be safely treated using 5-8 fractions. The 
  results of the current study warrant further studies of helical IMSBRT.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Tomotherapy for intensity-modulated radiation has been 
  demonstrated to reduce unnecessary irradiations to adjacent organs at risk 
  (OARs). The purpose of this study was to compare the dosimetric parameters 
  between Tomotherapy and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in 
  rectal cancer patients.
  
  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We redesigned three-dimensional conformal plans for 20 
  rectal cancer patients who had received short-course preoperative 
  radiotherapy with Tomotherapy. The target coverage for 3D-CRT and Tomotherapy 
  was evaluated with the following including the mean dose, V(nGy), D(min), 
  D(max), radiation conformality index (RCI), and radical dose homogeneity 
  index (rDHI).
  
  RESULTS: The mean PTV dose for Tomotherapy is significantly higher than that 
  observed for the 3D-CRT (p = 0.043). However, there is no significant 
  difference in the V(23.25Gy), V(26.25Gy), V(27.5Gy), and RCI values between 
  Tomotherapy and 3D-CRT. However, the average rDHI (p < 0.001) value for 
  Tomotherapy was significantly lower than that reported for the 3D-CRT. 
  Tomotherapy significantly lowered the mean level of irradiation doses to the 
  bladder, small bowel, and femur heads as compared to 3D-CRT.
  
  CONCLUSIONS: Tomotherapy could produce a favorable target coverage and 
  significant dose reduction for the OARs at the expense of acceptable dose 
  inhomogeneity of the PTV compared with 3D-CRT in rectal cancer patients.},

  abstract = {This planning study was performed to compare stereotactic linac based 
  radiosurgery of Arteriovenous Malformations (AVM) with current Helical Tomotherapy (HT)

  times of "regular" HT delivery (Reg 2.5/1/0.6 cm field width), Running-Start-Stop 
  Treatment (RSS 5/2.5 cm), Axial Mode (Axial 5 cm) and Dynamic Jaw/Dynamic Couch delivery

  stereotactic radiosurgery. Axial produced the fastest treatment (Axial 4:47 min vs. Linac 
  32:42 min) at the cost of large brain exposure (V10\% 289 ml). Except for Reg 0.6, all 
  other HT techniques achieved significantly shorter treatment times than linac-based 
  treatment (e.g. Reg 1, 19:42 min, DJDC 6:30 min). However, high-dose brain exposure 
  (V60\%) was higher in all HT plans (e.g. Reg 0.6, 10 ml, Linac 9 ml), and only Reg 0.6 
  showed better low-dose exposure (V10\% of 167 ml vs. 199 ml, not significant). Neither
