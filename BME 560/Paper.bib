@article{Gruen2013,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Establishing Total Body Irradiation (TBI) using 
  Helical Tomotherapy (HT) to gain better control over dose distribution and 
  homogeneity and to individually spare organs at risk. Because of their 
  limited body length the technique seems especially eligible in juvenile 
  patients.
  
  PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cohort consisted of 10 patients, 6 female and 4 
  male, aged 4 - 22 y with acute lymphoblastic- (ALL) or acute myeloic leukemia 
  (AML). All patients presented with high risk disease features. Body length in 
  treatment position ranged from 110-180 cm. Two Gy single dose was applied BID 
  to a total dose of 12 Gy. Dose volume constraint for the PTV was 95\% dose 
  coverage for 95\% of the volume. The lungs were spared to a mean dose of 
  [less than or equal to] 10 Gy. Patients were positioned in a vac-loc bag in 
  supine position with a 3-point head mask.
  
  RESULTS: Average D95 to the PTV was 11.7 Gy corresponding to a mean coverage 
  of the PTV of 97.5\%. Dmean for the lungs was 9.14 Gy. Grade 3-4 side effects 
  were not observed.
  
  CONCLUSIONS: TBI using HT is feasible and well tolerated. A benefit could be 
  demonstrated with regard to dose distribution and homogeneity and the 
  selective dose-reduction to organs at risk.},
